OVERVIEW

What is Python?
---------------

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it 
very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language 
to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability 
and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages 
program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available 
in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

Course Description
------------------

Python is a programming language that is becoming more and more popular for doing data science. 
Companies worldwide are using Python to harvest insights from their data and get a competitive edge. 
This course focuses on Python specifically for data science. In our Intro to Python class, 
you will learn about powerful ways to store and manipulate data.

History of Python
-----------------

Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute 
for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell 
and other scripting languages.

Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a 
vital role in directing its progress.

Features of Python Programming
------------------------------

**A simple language which is easier to learn** :
Python has a very simple and elegant syntax. It's much easier to read and write Python programs compared to other languages like: C++, Java, C#. Python makes programming fun and allows you to focus on the solution rather than syntax.
If you are a newbie, it's a great choice to start your journey with Python.

**Free and open-source** :
You can freely use and distribute Python, even for commercial use. Not only can you use and distribute softwares written in it, you can even make changes to the Python's source code.
Python has a large community constantly improving it in each iteration.

**Portability** :
You can move Python programs from one platform to another, and run it without any changes.
It runs seamlessly on almost all platforms including Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

**Extensible and Embeddable** :
Suppose an application requires high performance. You can easily combine pieces of C/C++ or other languages with Python code.
This will give your application high performance as well as scripting capabilities which other languages may not provide out of the box.

**Large standard libraries to solve common tasks** :
Python has a number of standard libraries which makes life of a programmer much easier since you don't have to write all the code yourself. For example: Need to connect MySQL database on a Web server? You can use MySQLdb library using import MySQLdb .
Standard libraries in Python are well tested and used by hundreds of people. So you can be sure that it won't break your application.

**Object-oriented** :
Everything in Python is an object. Object oriented programming (OOP) helps you solve a complex problem intuitively.
With OOP, you are able to divide these complex problems into smaller sets by creating objects.

Getting Python
-------------- 

The most up-to-date and current source code, binaries, documentation, news, etc., is available on the official 
website of Python https://www.python.org/

You can download Python documentation from https://www.python.org/doc/. The documentation is available in HTML, PDF, 
and PostScript formats. Installation_ instructions_.

Python/ Anaconda 
---------------- 

Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine 
learning related applications (large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, scientific computing), that aims to 
simplify package management and deployment. Package versions are managed by the package management system conda. 
The Anaconda distribution is used by over 6 million users, and it includes more than 250 popular data science packages 
suitable for Windows, Linux, and MacOS

Anaconda vs. Miniconda
----------------------

There are two options for getting Conda: Anaconda and miniconda. Anaconda is a full distribution of Python, 
and comes with over 150 packages in the download; consequently, this download is over 3GB. Anaconda is good 
if you want to have many packages downloaded and available in one shot; this is especially useful if you know 
you’ll be working offline for awhile. Miniconda contains only Python and other libraries needed to run Conda itself; 
other packages will be downloaded and installed as requested. 
  
Why Anaconda?
-------------

There’s no big reason to switch to Anaconda if you are completely happy with you regular python. But some people like data 
scientists who are not full time developers, find anaconda much useful as it simplifies lot of common problems a beginner runs into.

**Anaconda can help with –**

* Installing Python on multiple platforms
* Separating out different environments
* Getting up and running with specific packages and libraries



How to Install Anaconda?
------------------------

The free version of Anaconda distribution community edition can be downloaded_ directly from Anaconda’s website.
Once downloaded the .exe file, run through the installer. Do accept the terms, and finish installation. To check, close the browser and pull up the terminal.

Once the installation is complete, it should have automatically added that to the path. To test this, go ahead and type ‘python’.

The version of python i.e. 3 will show and also the anaconda distribution will be seen.
